              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being really   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> powerful with us, we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them. So I'm   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> watching this behavior in the classroom, and what do I notice? I notice that MBA students really exhibit the    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas, really coming into the   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> room, they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts, like they really want to occupy      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> space. When they sit down, they're sort of spread out. They raise their hands like this. You have other people  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in, you see it. You see it on their faces and <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> their bodies, and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny, and they go like this when they raise  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> their hand. I notice a couple of things about this. One, you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> related to gender. So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically less <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> powerful than men, so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be        <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> related to the extent to which the students were participating, and how well they were participating. And this  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> is really important in the MBA classroom, because participation counts for half the grade. So business schools  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> have been struggling with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> then you get these differences in grades, and it seems to be partly attributable to participation. So I started <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> to wonder, you know, okay, so you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating. Is it       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more? So my main             <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley, and I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> Like, can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> more powerful? So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> evidence. But our question really was, do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves? There's  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> some evidence that they do. So, for example, we smile when we feel happy, but also, when we're forced to smile  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> by holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power,  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful, you're more likely to do this, but it's also possible that   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> when you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful. So the second question really   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> was, you know, so we know that our minds change our bodies, but is it also true that our bodies change our      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> minds? And when I say minds, in the case of the powerful, what am I talking about? So I'm talking about         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings, and in my    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> case, that's hormones. I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like? <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> So powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly, more assertive and more confident, more optimistic. They       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance. They also tend to be able to think more abstractly. <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. There are a lot of differences between powerful and    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> powerless people. Physiologically, there also are differences on two key hormones: testosterone, which is the   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> dominance hormone, and cortisol, which is the stress hormone. So what we find is that high-power alpha males in <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol, and powerful and effective leaders also have high  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> testosterone and low cortisol. So what does that mean? When you think about power, people tended to think only  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> about testosterone, because that was about dominance. But really, power is also about how you react to stress.  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> So do you want the high-power leader that's dominant, high on testosterone, but really stress reactive?         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> Probably not, right? You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant, but not very stress         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> reactive, the person who's laid back. So we know that in primate hierarchies, if an alpha needs to take over,   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly, within a few days, that individual's        <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence,    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> both that the body can shape the mind, at least at the facial level, and also that role changes can shape the   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> mind. So what happens, okay, you take a role change, what happens if you do that at a really minimal level,     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> like this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention? \"For two minutes,\" you say, \"I want you to stand like      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> this, and it's going to make you feel more powerful.\" So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> the lab and run a little experiment, and these people adopted, for two minutes, either high-power poses or      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> low-power poses, and I'm just going to show you five of the poses, although they took on only two. So here's    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed the \"Wonder Woman\" by the media. Here are a couple more. So you    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> can be standing or you can be sitting. And here are the low-power poses. So you're folding up, you're making    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> yourself small. This one is very low-power. When you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> So this is what happens. They come in, they spit into a vial, for two minutes, we say, \"You need to do this or  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> this.\" They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them with a concept of power. We want   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them, \"How powerful do you feel?\" on a       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> series of items, and then we give them an opportunity to gamble, and then we take another saliva sample. That's <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> it. That's the whole experiment. So this is what we find. Risk tolerance, which is the gambling, we find that   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> when you are in the high-power pose condition, 86 percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low-power pose <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> condition, only 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone.  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> From their baseline when they come in, high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase, and low-power  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> people experience about a 10-percent decrease. So again, two minutes, and you get these changes. Here's what    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> you get on cortisol. High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease, and the low-power people         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> experience about a 15-percent increase. So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> to basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable, or really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> shut down. And we've all had the feeling, right? So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> feel about ourselves, so it's not just others, but it's also ourselves. Also, our bodies change our minds. But  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> the next question, of course, is, can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> ways? This is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> this? Which we cared about, of course. And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one that most people could relate to      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> because most people had been through, was the job interview. So we published these findings, and the media are  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> all over it, and they say, Okay, so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview, right? (Laughter) <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> You know, so we were of course horrified, and said, Oh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all. For         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this. You're sitting down. You're looking   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> at your iPhone -- or your Android, not trying to leave anyone out. You're looking at your notes, you're         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> right? Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay? So we bring people into a lab, and they <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview. It's five minutes     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> long. They are being recorded. They're being judged also, and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls \"standing in social   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> really wanted to see what happened. We then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them. They're blind  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions. They have no idea who's been posing in what pose, and they  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> end up looking at these sets of tapes, and they say, \"We want to hire these people,\" all the high-power posers. <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> driving it? It's not about the content of the speech. It's about the presence that they're bringing to the      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> speech. Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> speech? How good is it? What are their qualifications? No effect on those things. This is what's affected.      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves, basically. They're bringing themselves. They      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> effect, or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this, that our bodies change our minds and our     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> minds can change our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me, \"It feels fake.\"       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> Right? So I said, fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there and then still feel like a   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> be here. And that really resonated with me, because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here. When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident. I was thrown   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> out of a car, rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward, and I <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> had been withdrawn from college, and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations, which was     <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> very traumatic. I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart, and I had been called gifted as a       <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> child. So I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back. They say, \"You're not going to finish college.    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> Just, you know, there are other things for you to do, but that's not going to work out for you.\" So I really    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> struggled with this, and I have to say, having your identity taken from you, your core identity, and for me it  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> was being smart, having that taken from you, there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked.      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers, and I convinced someone, my    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> 20-minute talk to 20 people. That's it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> said, \"I'm quitting.\" She was like, \"You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.  <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> I'm doing it. Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'\" So that's what I did. Five years in grad    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> totally defeated, and she said, \"I'm not supposed to be here.\" And that was the moment for me. Because two      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> things happened. One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore. I don't feel that         <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling. And the second was, she is supposed to be here! Like, she can    <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> fake it, she can become it. So I was like, \"Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here! And tomorrow you're      <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",

              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
              "<span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span> faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you, don't fake it till you make it.   <span style=\"color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080\">â”‚</span>\n",
